  "user_flow_summary": [
    "New users start by registering or logging in via email/password or OAuth providers (Google, GitHub).",

    "Users analyze their resumes against job descriptions via the ATS Analyzer, receiving scores and optimization suggestions; they can then refine resumes accordingly.",
    "Users perform ML-based job matching by submitting job descriptions, viewing match scores, skill gaps, and recommendations.",
    "Users import GitHub projects via OAuth for automatic project addition in resumes.",
    "Admin users manage users, monitor AI analytics and quotas, handle contact and feedback messages, maintain templates, and adjust application settings through the admin panel."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Users must be able to register, login, and securely authenticate via both email/password and OAuth.",
    "Resume uploads should accept only valid PDF/DOCX files under 5MB and reject invalid or oversized files with clear errors.",
    "Rich text editor must reflect AI enhancements instantly and support drag-and-drop reorder without data loss.",
    "Resume saves should persist and be retrievable in the dashboard; deleted resumes are removed accurately.",
    "ATS Analyzer must accurately compute scores, keyword matches, and feedback consistent with provided job descriptions.",
    "ML job matching results should reflect correct compatibility scores and skill gap analyses.",
    "GitHub imports correctly populate project sections without duplication or data loss.",
    "Admin functionalities should respect role permissions, data should be accurate, and changes must persist.",
    "UI must be responsive across devices and support dark mode with theme persistence.",
    "Security best practices including rate limiting, data sanitization, JWT expiration, and role-based access control are enforced throughout."
