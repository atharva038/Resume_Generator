# 🎯 TLDR: One-Time Subscription Fix

## 🐛 The Problem

**Right now**: When one-time subscription expires, users can STILL use AI and download! 😱

**Your test**: You just paid ₹49 and it worked. But after 21 days, it should STOP working. Currently it doesn't! ❌

---

## ✅ The Solution

### Quick Fix (30 minutes):
Add subscription check before AI enhancement and downloads.

**Result**: When subscription expires → Everything stops working ✅

---

## 💡 The Choice

### Option A: **Simple (MY RECOMMENDATION)**
- When subscription **expires** → ALL resumes blocked ❌
- When you buy **again** → ALL resumes work again ✅
- **Easy to implement**: 30 minutes
- **Revenue**: Decent

### Option B: **Advanced**
- Each one-time purchase = **1 resume only**
- Old resumes stay **locked** even if you buy again
- Need **Pro** to unlock all resumes
- **More complex**: 2-3 hours
- **Revenue**: Best (forces Pro upgrades)
