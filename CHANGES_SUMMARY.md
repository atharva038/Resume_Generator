# Changes Summary - Job Role & Scoring System

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Removed Duplicate MERN Stack Entries
**Problem:** There were two MERN Stack entries:
- "MERN Stack Developer" in Backend section
- "MERN Full Stack Developer" in Full Stack section

**Solution:** 
- Removed the backend "MERN Stack Developer" entry
- Kept only "MERN Stack Developer" in the Full Stack section
- This eliminates confusion and provides a single, comprehensive MERN profile

### 2. ‚úÖ Added User-Editable Target Job Role
**Problem:** Users couldn't specify their target job role, and the score dropdown was hidden inside the scoring component

**Solution:** 
- Added `targetJobRole` field to `resumeData` (stored with the resume)
- Created a new "Target Job Role" editable section in the Editor
- Users can now select their target job from a dropdown
- The job-specific score automatically recalculates when they change the target role

## üìù Files Modified

### 1. **client/src/utils/jobProfiles.js**
- Removed duplicate `mern-stack-developer` from backend section
- Renamed `mern-fullstack-developer` to `mern-stack-developer`
- Now only one MERN Stack entry exists

### 2. **client/src/pages/Editor.jsx**
Changes:
- Added import: `import {getJobCategories, getJobsByCategory} from "../utils/jobProfiles"`
- Added "targetJob" to `DEFAULT_SECTION_ORDER` array
- Added `targetJobRole` initialization in `useEffect` (defaults to "software-engineer")
- Created new "Target Job Role" collapsible section with:
  - Organized dropdown by category
  - All job roles available
  - Helper text explaining its purpose
- Passed `onUpdateField` prop to `JobSpecificScoreCard`

### 3. **client/src/components/JobSpecificScoreCard.jsx**
Changes:
- Added `onUpdateField` prop to component signature
- Removed local `selectedJob` state
- Now reads `selectedJob` from `resumeData.targetJobRole`
- Added `handleJobChange` function that calls `onUpdateField`
- Updated `useEffect` dependencies to include `customTechStack`
- Score now auto-calculates when `resumeData.targetJobRole` changes

## üé® User Experience Improvements

### Before:
1. Users had to scroll down to find job-specific score section
2. Job selection was buried inside the scoring component
3. No clear indication of what job they're targeting
4. Multiple confusing MERN Stack options

### After:
1. ‚úÖ **Clear "Target Job Role" section** at the top of the editor
2. ‚úÖ **Visual feedback** - Users see exactly what job they're targeting
3. ‚úÖ **Auto-scoring** - Score updates automatically when job role changes
4. ‚úÖ **Persistent** - Target job role is saved with the resume
5. ‚úÖ **Only one MERN Stack option** - No confusion

## üîÑ How It Works Now

1. **User uploads resume** ‚Üí System initializes `targetJobRole` to "software-engineer"
2. **User edits Target Job Role section** ‚Üí Selects their desired role from dropdown
3. **Score auto-updates** ‚Üí JobSpecificScoreCard detects the change via `useEffect`
4. **Score recalculates** ‚Üí Shows updated match percentage and recommendations
5. **Both sections stay in sync** ‚Üí Target Job Role section and Job-Specific Score use same data

## üìä Section Order

New default order:
1. ATS Score (overall)
2. Job-Specific Score (detailed)
3. **üÜï Target Job Role** (user input)
4. Personal Information
5. Summary
6. Recommendations
7. Skills
8. Experience
9. Education
10. Projects
11. Certifications
