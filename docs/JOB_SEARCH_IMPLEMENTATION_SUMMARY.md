- [ ] Resume matching score per job
- [ ] Integration with "My Resumes" feature
- [ ] Job application tracking

### Phase 3 (Long-term)

- [ ] Result caching for performance
- [ ] Infinite scroll pagination
- [ ] Export jobs to PDF
- [ ] Share jobs with other users
- [ ] Mobile app integration

## Performance Considerations ⚡

### Current Implementation
- Direct API calls from frontend
- No caching (fresh results every search)
- 20 results per page (fast loading)
- Toast notifications (lightweight)

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Caching**: Store recent searches (5-10 minutes)
2. **Debouncing**: Delay search until user stops typing
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load job descriptions on expand
4. **Backend Proxy**: Move API calls to server
5. **IndexedDB**: Store favorite jobs locally

## Security Notes 🔒

### Current Setup
⚠️ API keys are in client-side code (visible in browser)

**Mitigation**:
- Free tier API keys (low risk)
- Rate limiting on Adzuna's side
- No sensitive user data exposed
- Read-only API access

### Production Recommendations
1. Create backend proxy endpoint
2. Store API keys server-side only
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add request authentication
5. Monitor API usage
