## How to Find Archived Documentation

### For Developers:
1. Go to `docs/archive/`
2. Read `docs/archive/README.md` for full index
3. Find specific feature documentation

### For Contributors:
- Check `CONTRIBUTING.md` first
- Refer to archived implementation docs when working on related features
- Use archived fix logs for debugging similar issues

### For Users:
- Start with `README.md`
- Use `QUICK_START.md` for setup
- Admin users: see `ADMIN_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`

---

## What to Do With New Documentation

### Add to Root if:
✅ It's core project documentation  
✅ Users need it frequently  
✅ It's about the overall system  
✅ It's a setup/configuration guide  

### Add to docs/archive/ if:
📚 It's feature-specific implementation details  
📚 It's a historical fix log  
📚 It's a detailed technical deep-dive  
📚 It's a one-time migration guide  
📚 It's visual guides/comparisons  

---

## Files That Should Be Considered For Root

If you're creating new documentation, keep it in root only if it's:

1. **User-facing guides** (like QUICK_START.md)
2. **Contribution guidelines** (like CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. **Project overview** (like README.md)
4. **Core feature docs** that users reference frequently
5. **Setup instructions** (like ADMIN_PANEL_README.md)

Everything else → `docs/archive/`

---

## Migration Commands Used

```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p docs/archive

# Move feature docs
mv CASCADING_JOB_SELECTION.md docs/archive/
mv CREATE_FROM_SCRATCH_FEATURE.md docs/archive/
mv ENGINEERING_SUBCATEGORIES.md docs/archive/
# ... (37 files total)

# Create archive README
echo "..." > docs/archive/README.md
```

---

## Verification

### Before Cleanup:
```
Root directory: 42 .md files
```

### After Cleanup:
```
Root directory: 7 .md files ✅
Archived: 37 .md files 📚
Total preserved: 44 .md files (7 + 37)
```

---

## Future Maintenance

### When Adding New Features:
1. Create detailed docs in `docs/archive/`
2. Add brief mention in main README.md
3. Update ROADMAP.md if it's a major feature

### When Updating Existing Features:
1. Update the main docs (README, QUICK_START)
2. Archive old implementation details
3. Keep current user guides in root

### Quarterly Review:
- Check if any root docs should be archived
- Update docs/archive/README.md with new entries
- Remove truly obsolete documentation
