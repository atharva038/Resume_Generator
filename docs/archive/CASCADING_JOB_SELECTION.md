# Cascading Job Selection Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the Job-Specific ATS Score section with **multiple cascading dropdowns** to make job selection more organized, intuitive, and easier to navigate.

---

## Problem Statement
Previously, users had to scroll through a single long dropdown with all job roles grouped by category. This was:
- ❌ Overwhelming with too many options
- ❌ Hard to find specific roles quickly
- ❌ No filtering by experience level
- ❌ Poor user experience for job discovery

---

## Solution Implemented

### New Multi-Step Job Selection Process:

```
Step 1: Select Job Category
    ↓
Step 2: Choose Experience Level
    ↓
Step 3: Pick Specific Job Role (Filtered)
```

---

## Features Added

### 1. **Job Category Dropdown**
**Label:** "1. Job Category"

**Options:**
- All Categories (shows all)
- Engineering
- Design
- Management
- Data & Analytics
- DevOps & Cloud
- Marketing
- Product
- Sales
- Support
- Security

**Behavior:**
- Filters the job role dropdown based on selected category
- Shows count of available roles in that category
- Defaults to category of currently selected job

---

### 2. **Experience Level Dropdown**
**Label:** "2. Experience Level"

**Options:**
- All Levels (no filtering)
- Entry Level (0-2 years)
- Junior (1-3 years)
- Mid-Level (3-5 years)
- Senior (5-8 years)
- Lead/Staff (8+ years)
- Principal/Architect (10+ years)

**Behavior:**
- Currently displays all levels (foundation for future filtering)
- Can be extended to filter roles by experience requirements
- Helps users identify appropriate career level

**Future Enhancement:**
Can filter jobs based on `minExperience` field in job profiles:
```javascript
if (selectedExperienceLevel !== 'all') {
  jobs = jobs.filter(job => {
    const jobMinExp = job.minExperience || 0;
    // Match experience ranges to job requirements
  });
}
```

---

### 3. **Specific Job Role Dropdown**
**Label:** "3. Specific Job Role"

**Dynamic Behavior:**
- **When category selected:** Shows only roles in that category
- **When no category:** Shows all roles grouped by category (old behavior)
- **Shows count:** "(X roles in Category Name)"

**Example:**
- Select "Engineering" → Shows only engineering roles
- Select "Design" → Shows only design roles
- No selection → Shows all roles with optgroup labels

---

### 4. **Helper Tip Box**
Blue informational box with guidance:
```
💡 Tip: Select a category first to narrow down job roles, 
then choose your experience level for better matching.
```

**Styling:**
- Blue background in light mode
- Dark blue background in dark mode
- Border with blue accent
- Small text with icon

---

## Technical Implementation

### File Modified:
`client/src/components/JobSpecificScoreCard.jsx`

### New State Variables:
```javascript
const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState("");
const [selectedExperienceLevel, setSelectedExperienceLevel] = useState("all");
const [filteredJobs, setFilteredJobs] = useState([]);
```

### Experience Levels Data:
```javascript
const experienceLevels = [
  { value: "all", label: "All Levels" },
  { value: "entry", label: "Entry Level (0-2 years)" },
  { value: "junior", label: "Junior (1-3 years)" },
  { value: "mid", label: "Mid-Level (3-5 years)" },
  { value: "senior", label: "Senior (5-8 years)" },
  { value: "lead", label: "Lead/Staff (8+ years)" },
  { value: "principal", label: "Principal/Architect (10+ years)" }
];
```

### Auto-Initialization Logic:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Set category based on currently selected job
  if (selectedJob && !selectedCategory) {
    const jobProfile = allJobs.find(job => job.key === selectedJob);
    if (jobProfile) {
      setSelectedCategory(jobProfile.category);
    }
  }
}, [selectedJob, allJobs]);
```

### Filtering Logic:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  let jobs = allJobs;
  
  if (selectedCategory) {
    jobs = jobs.filter(job => job.category === selectedCategory);
  }
  
  // Future: Experience level filtering can be added here
  
  setFilteredJobs(jobs);
}, [selectedCategory, selectedExperienceLevel, allJobs]);
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: New User
1. Opens editor with default job (Software Engineer)
2. Sees category auto-populated to "Engineering"
3. Can change category to explore other fields
4. Dropdown narrows to show only relevant roles

### Scenario 2: Career Changer
1. Wants to switch from Engineering to Design
2. Selects "Design" in category dropdown
3. Job role dropdown updates to show only design roles
4. Chooses "UI/UX Designer"
5. Score recalculates for new role

### Scenario 3: Experience Level Focus
1. Junior developer looking for entry-level roles
2. Selects "Entry Level (0-2 years)"
3. (Future) Sees only appropriate roles
4. Makes informed decision about target role

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Hierarchy:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Target Job Selection                │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Job Category          [Dropdown] │
│    └─ All Categories / Engineering  │
│                                      │
│ 2. Experience Level      [Dropdown] │
│    └─ All Levels / Junior / Senior  │
│                                      │
│ 3. Specific Job Role     [Dropdown] │
│    └─ (12 roles in Engineering)     │
│    └─ Software Engineer              │
│                                      │
│ 💡 Tip: Select category first...    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
