# Engineering Specialization Subcategories

## Overview
Added **Engineering Specialization** subcategory dropdown to the Job-Specific ATS Score section, allowing users to filter engineering roles by specific domains like Frontend, Backend, Full Stack, Mobile, DevOps, etc.

---

## Problem Statement
The Engineering category had 40+ different roles mixed together:
- ❌ Frontend, Backend, and DevOps roles all lumped together
- ❌ Hard to find specific specialization (e.g., only React roles)
- ❌ No distinction between development domains
- ❌ Overwhelming choice for users

---

## Solution: Engineering Subcategories

### New 4-Step Selection for Engineering Roles:

```
Step 1: Select Category → Engineering
    ↓
Step 2: Choose Specialization → Frontend Development
    ↓
Step 3: Pick Experience Level → Mid-Level (3-5 years)
    ↓
Step 4: Select Specific Role → React Developer
```

## Technical Implementation

### Job Subcategory Mapping:
```javascript
const jobSubCategoryMap = {
  // Frontend
  "frontend-developer": "frontend",
  "react-developer": "frontend",
  "angular-developer": "frontend",
  "vue-developer": "frontend",
  
  // Backend
  "backend-developer": "backend",
  "nodejs-developer": "backend",
  "python-developer": "backend",
  "java-developer": "backend",
  
  // Full Stack
  "full-stack-developer": "fullstack",
  "mern-stack-developer": "fullstack",
  
  // Mobile
  "mobile-developer": "mobile",
  "ios-developer": "mobile",
  "android-developer": "mobile",
  "react-native-developer": "mobile",
  
  // DevOps
  "devops-engineer": "devops",
  "cloud-engineer": "devops",
  "sre": "devops",
  
  // Database
  "database-administrator": "database",
  "data-engineer": "database",
  
  // AI/ML
  "machine-learning-engineer": "ai-ml",
  "ai-engineer": "ai-ml",
  "data-scientist": "ai-ml",
  
  // Security
  "security-engineer": "security",
  "cybersecurity-analyst": "security",
  
  // Game
  "game-developer": "game",
  "unity-developer": "game"
};
```

### Auto-Initialization:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedJob && !selectedCategory) {
    const jobProfile = allJobs.find(job => job.key === selectedJob);
    if (jobProfile) {
      setSelectedCategory(jobProfile.category);
      // Auto-set subcategory for engineering roles
      if (jobProfile.category === "Engineering" && jobSubCategoryMap[selectedJob]) {
        setSelectedSubCategory(jobSubCategoryMap[selectedJob]);
      }
    }
  }
}, [selectedJob, allJobs]);
```

### Filtering Logic:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  let jobs = allJobs;
  
  if (selectedCategory) {
    jobs = jobs.filter(job => job.category === selectedCategory);
    
    // Apply subcategory filter for Engineering
    if (selectedCategory === "Engineering" && selectedSubCategory) {
      jobs = jobs.filter(job => 
        jobSubCategoryMap[job.key] === selectedSubCategory
      );
    }
  }
  
  setFilteredJobs(jobs);
}, [selectedCategory, selectedSubCategory, selectedExperienceLevel, allJobs]);
```
