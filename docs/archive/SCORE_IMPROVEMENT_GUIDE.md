## üöÄ Step-by-Step Improvement Plan

### **Step 1: Fix Experience Section (Gain 5-10 Points)**

**Why it matters:** Experience is worth 25 points - more than any other section!

#### ‚úÖ Action Items:

1. **Add Quantifiable Metrics** (Worth 5 points)
   - ‚ùå Bad: "Managed a team of developers"
   - ‚úÖ Good: "Led team of 8 developers, delivered 12 projects on time"
   
   **Formula:** Add numbers to 50%+ of your bullets
   - Revenue/costs: "Increased revenue by 30% ($2M)"
   - Team size: "Managed team of 5 engineers"
   - Time saved: "Reduced processing time by 40%"
   - Quantity: "Processed 500+ client requests monthly"

2. **Start Every Bullet with Action Verbs** (Worth 5 points)
   - Replace weak verbs: "Responsible for" ‚Üí "Led", "Managed", "Executed"
